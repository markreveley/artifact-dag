The documents about this repo and its work, in the layout
[repo-template](https://github.com/markreveley/repo-template) sets: its
seven default folders, each with a README, and `research/`, this repo's
addition.

| folder | holds | file name |
|---|---|---|
| [`governance/`](governance/README.md) | the documents that govern the repo | the five fixed names |
| [`docs/`](docs/README.md) | how to use and work on what the repo holds | `<topic>.md` |
| [`plans/`](plans/README.md) | what will be done, in order, and what it waits on | `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/<slug>.md` |
| [`analysis/`](analysis/README.md) | dated findings and recommendations | `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/<slug>.md` |
| [`issues/`](issues/README.md) | dated findings against something | `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` |
| [`audits/`](audits/README.md) | a dated reading of the repo against what it claims to be | `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` |
| [`tested/`](tested/README.md) | one report per run of something only a run can check | `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<kind>.md` |
| [`research/`](research/README.md) | dated surveys of tools and prior work outside the repo, with sources; added here, not a template default | `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/<slug>.md` |

A survey reports and an analysis recommends: an analysis that rests on a
survey links to it in its "Sources read".

## About this folder (repo-template `05156a6`)

The repo's documents about itself and its work. The seven folders below
exist in every repo, each with its README, whether or not anything is in it
yet (root README, guideline 1).

| folder | holds | file name |
|---|---|---|
| [`governance/`](governance/README.md) | the documents that govern the repo | the five fixed names |
| [`docs/`](docs/README.md) | how to use and work on what the repo holds | `<topic>.md` |
| [`plans/`](plans/README.md) | what will be done, in order, and what it waits on | `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/<slug>.md` |
| [`analysis/`](analysis/README.md) | dated findings and recommendations | `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/<slug>.md` |
| [`issues/`](issues/README.md) | dated findings against something | `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` |
| [`audits/`](audits/README.md) | a dated reading of the repo against what it claims to be | `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` |
| [`tested/`](tested/README.md) | one report per run of something only a run can check | `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<kind>.md` |

Each folder's README says what belongs there and what does not. A repo may
add a folder here (`glossary/` exists elsewhere) if it gives it a README on the same pattern and a row in this table.

Where a document goes when it could go in two places:

- It says what to do next: a plan. It says what was found: an analysis. A
  document that does both is an analysis whose recommendations become a
  plan's steps, linked both ways.
- It records a problem in something: an issue. Something was learned from
  fixing it: `docs/`.
- It is a rule, a format, a method, a design or a principle that the repo
  lives by: governance. One that applies to one piece of the repo only:
  `docs/`.
- No document here holds an open question. A question that blocks the next
  step goes in `next-operator.md`; any other goes in a plan linked from it.
